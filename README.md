# Utah_BrainToText25
Algorithms and Software for submission to Brain-to-text '25

We propose ALAN-D, *A Language Algorithm for Neural Decoding*.

ALAN-D is based off of the baseline RNN speech decoding algorithm designed by UCD.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Replicate results from Baseline
- [ ] Implementation of Winning 2024 algorithm
-
